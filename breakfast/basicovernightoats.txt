My basic recipe for overnight oats

Ingredients:
- 15g chia seeds
- 20g oat flakes (or spelt flakes)
- 10g oat bran
- 200ml coconut or almond milk
- 100g natural yoghurt or if you like to keep it vegan use a plant based yoghurt
- 20g mixed nuts or cocoa nibs
- 5ml Alga Oil (lemon flavour: https://www.norsan.de/shop/omega-3-vegan/)
- 150g fruits (preferable low in sugar, such as berries, water melon, grapefruit, orange, kiwi)
- for flavoring you can add cinnamon, vanilla or curcuma (as much as you like)

Step by step instructions
1. On the evening bevor: mix chia seeds, flakes, oat bran, milk, natural yoghurt, nuts and the preferred flavouring. The mixture will be thin, but it will thicken up until the morning.
2. In the morning you take out the mixture and add the alga oil and the sliced fruit.
