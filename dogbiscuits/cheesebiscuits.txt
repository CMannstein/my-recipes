Cheesebiscuits

Ingredients:
- 100g cottage cheese
- 70g gouda
- 30g parmesan cheese
- 10g coconut oil
- 1 egg
- 50ml water
- 100g oatmeal

Step by step instructions
1. Mix cottage cheese, gouda and egg in a bowl. Blend everything into a smooth dough.
2. Add parmesan cheese, coconut oil and oatmeal into the smooth dough. Mix it up until you get a homogeneous mass. Add as much water as you need to get the right dough consistency.
3. Pre heat your oven up to 180°C or if you have an convection oven 160°C is enough.
4. Add the dough on your dog biscuit baking mat (I use those: https://collorystore.de).
5. Bake the biscouits for 8 to 10 minutes. If you like to store the biscuits outside of your fridge, you need to dry them. Therefore you spread them evenly on your baking tray and bake them for up to 5 hours up to 80°C. Keep the door to your oven a crack wide open, thus the moisture can eluse.
