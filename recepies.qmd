Savory Pineapple Teriyaki Tacos with Spicy Wasabi Guacamole
Ingredients:
For the Tacos:

8 small corn tortillas
2 cups cooked and shredded chicken (or tofu for a vegetarian option)
1 cup pineapple chunks (fresh or canned)
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 avocado, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
For the Teriyaki Sauce:

1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water
For the Spicy Wasabi Guacamole:

2 ripe avocados
1 teaspoon wasabi paste (adjust to taste)
1 small lime, juiced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:
Prepare the Teriyaki Sauce:

In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, honey (or maple syrup), rice vinegar, sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Mix cornstarch with water to create a slurry, then add it to the saucepan. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.
Cook the Pineapple and Vegetables:

In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
Add pineapple chunks, red bell pepper, and red onion. Sauté until the vegetables are tender and the pineapple is slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes.
Add the shredded chicken (or tofu) to the skillet and pour in the teriyaki sauce. Stir to coat everything evenly and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Prepare the Spicy Wasabi Guacamole:

In a medium bowl, mash the avocados.
Add wasabi paste, lime juice, minced garlic, chopped cilantro, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Adjust seasoning and wasabi level to taste.
Assemble the Tacos:

Warm the corn tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave.
Spoon the teriyaki chicken and vegetable mixture onto each tortilla.
Top with diced avocado, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and fresh cilantro.
Serve:

Serve the tacos with a generous dollop of spicy wasabi guacamole on the side or on top.
Optionally, garnish with extra lime wedges and sesame seeds.
