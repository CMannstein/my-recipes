Welcome to "My favourite recipies for everyday life". Originally, this repository was designed as part of a git course at university in 2024.

Description:
It contains different recepies for humans and dogs. I prefere to do my own cooking for my family and animals. Thus I know which ingredients are in every meal. I hope to offer some new cooking ideas and this side is under constante developement.

Contributing:
Contributions are always welcome. If you try a recipe and it doesn't work out or you have your own recipe you like to share, I'm looking forward to hear from you.
